 J-Alice is an AIML engine written in C++. It comes with a builtin IRC client, with support for multiple channels and servers, and a small webserver. Each IRC setup (per irc network/server) supports configuration of an IRC Server, to allow the botmaster, for example, to connect and control the bot, and even pretend to be a bot with your favourite IRC client. 

FIXME: don't we original jalice, recource leak happens everywhere.
