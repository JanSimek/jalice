Silly changelog:

Version 0.3.1
=============

- Fixed bug in SocketHandler, that would not let it handle requests upon restarting the handling loop
- Loaded AIML that gets modified is automatically reloaded (unfortunately this is not guaranteed to happen)
- Removed merging support (in favour of automagic file reloading)
- Changed console interaction to use user's name (if known), and bot's name in the prompts (nothing special)
- Lessened normalisation, preserving formatting in wildcards, set, and get, etc.
- Changed normalisation, so that replaced words are in lowercase
- Automagically set user's name to their IRC nick if name is unknown
- Added commandline option to convert temporary.data to temporary.aiml (overwriting any previous temporary.aiml file), and then quit (easier than writing a separate program, hehe). This is invoked by passing --convert as the only option to j-alice
- Added timing facility, used only in loading at the moment
- Tidied up the learning display in console .. nice and tabular now :-)
- Fixed Database to remove newlines from data elements (screwed it up good otherwise), and made it put data in .csv files instead of extensionless filenames (then can double-click it, and even view in Excel)
- Got the basics of an XML over Sockets server built. Have a Flash client that can interact using XML over Sockets as well, which is quite cool. Still have a fair way to go yet though
- Altered Socket API to allow it to send terminating null bytes (example service requiring terminating null bytes is Flash 5+)
- Fixed small bug in console output, where it wouldn't display sentences 1 character long
- Fixed sentence splitting to cause a crash when sentence contained only whitespace
- Added error notification about detected infinite loops, and set max recursion depth to 32 (ie: only 32 nested recursive calls allowed)
- Fixed obscure bug in sentence splitting
- Corrected substituter, so that it normalises lowercase input as well
- Added JavaScript support to BeOS package (Date class works, unlike Win32 still)
- Got CDATA sections working now (makes tracking errors in scripts easier, and fixed yet another obscure problem due to newlines previously being stripped out combined with // style comments)

Version 0.3
===========

- Dramatic decrease in memory usage (~12MB for Anna AIML on Win32)
- Simple authorisation capabilities to prevent people screwing with your bot (simple-auth.aiml)
- Experimental web server (webserver.aiml)
- Javascript support for Win32 platform (still large number of bugs, and lack of features)
- Miscellaneous fixes to IRC (example commands in irc-conn.aiml)
- Logging for IRC and web server
- Attribute functions (examples in programming.aiml)
- Bootstrapping option (std-startup.aiml), disabled using --manual
- Learnt AIML saved to & loaded from temporary.data (not in XML format, nor easily editable). Conversion utility to come later
- Substitutions moved to substitutions.xml
